About the submission:



1) The submission should be a zip file containing only the necessary files to run your
project.
2) I will run the code on a clean venv Python 3.9.0 generated as :



stelios➜ ~ ᐅ python3 --version
Python 3.9.0
stelios➜ ~ ᐅ python3 -m venv virtualenv-[name]
stelios➜ ~ ᐅ ls virtualenv-name/bin/activate
virtualenv-name/bin/activate



3) Upon extracting the submission, I will run pip -r to install any requirements
which should be listed in the root of the project in a requirements.txt file.
4) After installing the requirements I will run a single executable which should be
capable of managing the different tasks using command line arguments. The name
of the arguments, and their restrictions are up to you.
